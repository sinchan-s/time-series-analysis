### [Chapter 5: Darts-NBEATS](https://github.com/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa-darts.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa_darts.ipynb)
- Python library developed by Unit8 for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series. This idea was to make darts as simple to use as sklearn for time-series. Darts attempts to smooth the overall process of using time series in machine learning. Darts has two models: Regression models (predicts output with time as input) and Forecasting models (predicts future output based on past values).
- contains time series analysis using **darts**:  model fitting using NBEATS, prediction, mape checking & plotting. Here's, the [colab code](https://github.com/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa_darts.ipynb)

### [Chapter 6: Tsfresh (Time Series Feature Extraction Based on Scalable Hypothesis Tests)](https://github.com/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa-tsfresh.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa-tsfresh.ipynb)
- It is a Python package that automatically calculates and extracts several time series features for classification and regression tasks. Hence, this library is mainly used for feature engineering in time series problems and other packages like sklearn to analyze the time series.
- contains time series analysis using **tsfresh**:  future data forecasting.

### [Chapter 7: Kats (Kits to Analyze Time Series)](https://github.com/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa-kats.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa-kats.ipynb)
- An open-source Python library developed by researchers at Facebook (now Meta). This library is easy to use and is helpful for time series problems. This is due to its very light weighted library of generic time series analysis which allows to set up the models quicker without spending so much time processing time series and calculations in different models.
- contains time series analysis using **kats**:   model fitting using Prophet instance, prediction & plotting.

### [Chapter 8: Greykite](https://github.com/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa-greykite.ipynb)

- It is a time-series forecasting library released by LinkedIn to simplify prediction for data scientists. This library offers automation in forecasting tasks using the primary forecasting algorithm ‘Silverkite.’ This library also helps interpret outputs making it a go-to tool for most time-series forecasting projects.
- contains time series analysis using **greykite**:   forecasting & plotting.

### [Chapter 9: AutoTS (Automatic Time Series)](https://github.com/sinchan-s/time-series-analysis/blob/main/tsa-autots.ipynb)
